# Introduction

Do you remember the classic hangman game we one time played in our life?
Well... it is back! With a litle changes to make it a little bit more difficult... or easy...
It consists on guessing the 5 letter Secret Word that generates randomly each time you refresh the page.

# Instructions 

You can only submit a 5 letter word that exists on the game library... 
if you thought you could cheat the system... think again. 
Each time you submit your guess, each letter will change its background color. 
Green indicates that the letter is in the correct position.
Yellow indicates that the letter is misplaced.
Gray indicates that the letter it is not on the word. 

Take some time, dont rush, that you only have 5 tries, and you would hate it to misuse one.

LETÂ´S PLAY!!
